# checkouter

CLI tool to check out your branches more easily

## how to install

Install globally using npm:

`npm install -g checkouter`

## how to use

You can use both `checkouter` or shorthand `cor` alias to display the list of available branches. Each will have a number assigned to it, so just type the one you want to switch to and press enter. Pressing enter without selecting a number will just dismiss the dialog.
